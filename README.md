# lm_1b_wrapper

Google provides a language model trained on 1 billion words [here](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/lm_1b). However, while they provide a script for doing a few things with that model from the command-line, there is no nice API for programmatic access. This repository provides such a limited version of such an API (restricted to a few tasks I find useful).
