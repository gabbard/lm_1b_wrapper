The music room in the Governor 's House at Port Mahon , a tall , handsome , pillared octagon , was filled with the triumphant first movement of Loctelli 's C major quartet .
The players were playing with passionate conviction .
The listener was a man of between twenty and thirty whose form overflowed his seat .
If you really must beat the measure , sir , let me entreat you to do it in time , and not half a beat ahead .
